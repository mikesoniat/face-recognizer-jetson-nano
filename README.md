# face-recognizer-jetson-nano
AI Face Recognition with Jetson Nano Using OpenCV and face_recognition to identify known faces.

This repository includes my PowerPoint presentation, which describes the software libraries and components used, the python source code, and my training, testing, and recognized images in separate folders. I also included a screenshot of a live video recognition during a zoom call.

<h1>Project Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Build a Python program that can recognize faces in photos</li>
<li>Use OpenCV library for computer vision</li>
<li>Use the Jetson Nano Developer Kit</li>
<li>Use open source Dlib machine learning library</li>
<li>Use open-source Python face-recognition library</li>
<li>Train the program on known faces</li>
<li>Recognize those trained faces in random photos</li>

</ul>
